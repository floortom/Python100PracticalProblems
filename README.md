## 100 Python Practice Exercises

This is a collection of 100 self-contained Python exercises I completed to sharpen my programming skills and deepen my understanding of core Python concepts. The exercises range from simple scripts to more advanced problems involving debugging, file handling, and small applications like chatbots and password generators.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Reinforced and expanded my Python fundamentals—variables, functions, conditionals, loops, data structures, and more  
- Practiced thinking through problems independently, improving both accuracy and speed  
- Learned multiple approaches to solving the same problem by comparing my solutions with expert implementations  
- Developed confidence in writing clean, readable, and efficient code  
- Improved my debugging skills through bug-fix challenges  

### 🧪 Topics & Examples
Some of the types of exercises included:
- ✅ Removing duplicates from a list  
- ✅ Generating random passwords  
- ✅ Reading and analyzing file contents  
- ✅ Fixing logic and syntax errors in broken code  
- ✅ Building a simple chatbot from scratch  
- ✅ Identifying and returning the smallest file in a directory  

The difficulty gradually increases, giving a progressive learning curve—from beginner-friendly to interview-level challenges.

### 🔍 Why This Matters
This kind of hands-on problem solving has significantly improved my coding fluency and confidence. The problems covered here reflect many common tasks and patterns found in real-world development and job interviews, making this a practical and career-relevant project.
